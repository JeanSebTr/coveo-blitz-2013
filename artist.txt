Life and career  Shakira was born on February 2, 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia. She is the only child of Nidia Ripoll and William Mebarak Chadid. Her paternal grandparents emigrated from Lebanon to New York City, where her father was born.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> From her mother Nidia Ripoll she has Spanish (Catalan and Castilian) and Italian descent.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>[http://numberonestars.com/shakira/shakira_interviews_5.htm Shakira: dELIAs Interview]: \"Through my veins runs Spanish, Lebanese and Italian blood\".</ref> She has eight older half-siblings from her father's previous marriage.<ref name=ShakiraTimes200903> (subscription required)</ref>  Shakira spent much of her youth in Barranquilla, a city located in northern Colombia. Shakira wrote her first poem, entitled \"La Rosa De Cristal\" (\"The Crystal Rose\") when she was only four years old. As she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a typewriter, and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got her wish at age seven and continued writing poetry. These poems eventually evolved into songs. At the age of two, an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident and at the age of eight, Shakira wrote her first song entitled \"Tus gafas oscuras\" (\"Your dark glasses\"), which was inspired by her father, who for years wore dark glasses, to hide his grief.<ref></ref> When Shakira was four, her father took her to a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the doumbek, a traditional drum used in Arabic music and which typically accompanied belly dancing.<ref name=rollingstone/> Before she knew it, Shakira was dancing on the table, she then knew she wanted to be a performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in the second grade was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded \"like a goat\".<ref name=rollingstone></ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1890000/1890956.stm Shakira: 'I don't hate Britney'], ''BBC News'', March 24, 2002.

The images stayed with her and she said to herself \"one day I’m going to help these kids when I become a famous artist.\"<ref name=ShakiraTimes200903/> Between the ages of ten and thirteen Shakira was invited to various events in Barranquilla and gained some recognition in the area.<ref name=\"Gale\"></ref>It was at about this time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career. During a flight from Barranquilla to Bogotá, Ariza convinced Sony Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a hotel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of \"a lost cause\". Vargas, not daunted, was still convinced that Shakira had talent, and set up an audition in Bogotá. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira's performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.<ref name=\"driven\"></ref>  1990–97: Music debut and ''Pies Descalzos''  Shakira's debut album, ''Magia'', was recorded with Sony Music Colombia in 1990 when she was only thirteen years old.<ref name=\"Shakira biography\"/> The songs are a collection made by her since she was 8, mixed pop-rock ballads and disco uptempo songs with electronic accompaniment, however it was hampered by a lack of recording and production cohesion. The album was released in June 1991 and featured \"Magia\" and three other singles. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially as only 1,200 copies were sold worldwide.<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> After the poor performance of ''Magia'', Shakira's label urged her to return to the studio to release a follow-up record. Although little known outside of her native Colombia, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile's Viña del Mar International Song Festival in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges. Shakira performed the ballad \"Eres\" (\"You Are\") and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was then 20-year-old Ricky Martin.<ref name=\"Shakira biography\"/>  Shakira's second studio album ''Peligro'' was released in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than ''Magia'', though it was also considered a commercial failure due to Shakira's refusal to advertise it. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school.<ref name=\"Shakira biography\"/> In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV Series \"The Oasis\", loosely based on the Armero tragedy in 1985.<ref></ref> Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums.  Shakira originally recorded the song \"¿Dónde Estás Corazón?\" (later released on her album ''Pies Descalzos'') for the compilation album ''Nuestro Rock'' in 1995, released exclusively in Colombia.<ref></ref> “Pies Descalzos” album brought her great popularity in Latin America by the hit singles \"Estoy Aquí,\" \"Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos\" and \"Dónde Estás Corazón.\"<ref name=\"Shakira biography\"/> Shakira also recorded three tracks in Portuguese titled “Estou Aqui”, “Um Pouco de Amor”, and “Pés Descalços”.  Shakira returned to recording music under Sony Music along with Columbia in 1995 with Luis F. Ochoa, using musical influences from a number of countries and an Alanis Morissette-oriented persona which affected two of her next albums.<ref></ref> These recordings spawned her third studio album but first official, ''Pies Descalzos''. Recording for the album began in February 1995, after the success of her single \"¿Dónde Estás Corazón?\". Sony gave Shakira $100,000 to produce the album since they predicted that the album would not sell past 100,000 copies. Starting with this album, Shakira began producing her own music, perfecting her vocals and most of all, practicing creative control over her music. Highly influenced by the American alternative market and British groups such as ''The Pretenders'', the album's songs are melodic, musically surprising and gritty, with intellectual lyrics and an electronic/acoustic blend that effectively broke the formulaic mold of Latin pop with an authentic sound that had not been heard before.  The album ''Pies Descalzos'', was released in October 1995 in South America and in February 1996 internationally. It debuted at number one in eight different countries. However, it only managed to reach number one-hundred-eighty on the U.S. Billboard 200 but reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. The album spawned six hit singles, \"Estoy Aquí\" which reached number two on the U.S. Latin chart, \"¿Dónde Estás Corazón?\" which reached number five on the U.S. Latin chart, \"Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos\" which reached number eleven on the U.S. Latin chart, \"Un Poco De Amor\" which reached number six on the U.S. Latin chart, \"Antología\" which reached number fifteen on the U.S. Latin Pop Songs chart and \"Se Quiere, Se Mata\" which reached number eight on the U.S. Latin chart.<ref></ref> In August 1996, RIAA certified the album platinum status.<ref></ref>  In March 1996, Shakira went on to her first international tour named simply the ''Tour Pies Descalzos''. The tour consisted of 20 shows and ended in 1997. Also in that year, Shakira received three Billboard Latin Music Awards for Album of the Year for ''Pies Descalzos'', Video of the Year for \"Estoy Aqui\" and Best New Artist.<ref></ref> ''Pies Descalzos'' later sold over 5 million copies,<ref></ref><ref></ref> prompting the release of a remix album, simply titled ''The Remixes''. ''The Remixes'' also included Portuguese versions of some of her well known songs, which were recorded as a result of her success in the Brazilian market, where ''Pies Descalzos'' sold nearly one million copies.<ref name=\"Gale\"/> left|thumb|upright|Shakira during her Tour Anfibio  1998–2000: ''¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?'' and ''MTV Unplugged''  Her second official studio album, ''¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?'', produced entirely by Shakira herself and Emilio Estefan, Jr. as the executive producer, was released in September 1998. The album, inspired by an incident in an airport in which a suitcase full of her written lyrics was stolen, became a bigger hit than ''Pies Descalzos''. Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave the album a four out of five stars rating. The album has reached a peak position of number one-hundred-thirty-one on the U.S. ''Billboard 200'' and held the top spot on the U.S. Latin Albums chart for eleven weeks. It has since sold over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it one of the best selling Spanish albums in the U.S. Eight of the album's eleven tracks became singles, including \"Ciega, Sordomuda\", \"Moscas En La Casa\", \"No Creo\" which became her first single to chart on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100, \"Inevitable\", \"Tú\", \"Si Te Vas\", \"Octavo Día\", and the world-famous, Arabic tinged \"Ojos Así\". The latter two songs won Shakira one Latin Grammy each with six of the eight singles reaching the top 40 on the U.S. Latin chart.  ''¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?'' has sold seven million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"Shakira Tour\"/> Shakira also received her first Grammy Award nomination in 1999 for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album.<ref></ref> Shakira's first live album, ''MTV Unplugged'' was recorded in New York City on August 12, 1999. Highly acclaimed by American critics, it is rated as one of her best-ever live performances.<ref></ref> The live album earned the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2001 and gained sales of five million worldwide.<ref></ref> In March 2000, Shakira embarked on her ''Tour Anfibio'', a two-month tour of Latin America and the United States. In August 2000, she won an MTV Video Music Award in the now-defunct category of People's Choice — Favorite International Artist for \"Ojos Así\". On September 9, 2000, Shakira performed \"Ojos Así\" at the inaugural ceremony of the Latin Grammy Awards, where she was nominated in five categories: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for ''MTV Unplugged'', Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for \"Octavo Día\", Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video for the video for \"Ojos Así\",<ref></ref> but she won only two of the awards. Shakira's performance of \"Ojos Así\" at the awards show was voted as the Greatest Latin Grammy performance of all time. right|thumb|upright|Shakira during her Tour of the Mongoose in 2003  2001–04: ''Laundry Service'' and international success  Upon the success of ''Dónde Están los Ladrones?'' and ''MTV Unplugged'', Shakira began working on an English crossover album. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably that of Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, the crossover of Spanish artists to the English market had a great surge of popularity in mainstream music and it was the next logical step to Shakira and her label for her career.<ref></ref> Shakira worked for over a year on new material for the album. \"Whenever, Wherever\" (\"Suerte\" in Spanish countries) was released as the first and lead single from Shakira's first English album and third studio album throughout the period of August 2001 and February 2002. The song took heavy influence from Andean music, including the charango and panpipes in its instrumentation. The track was produced by Shakira, and it was an international success by reaching number one in most countries. It was also her first success in the U.S., by reaching number six on the Hot 100. In 2003, Shakira wrote a song called \"Come Down Love\" with Tim Mitchell for the Hollywood movie ''The Italian Job'' starring South African actress Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg, but the song was not included on the soundtrack of the same name.  Shakira's third studio album and first English language album ''Laundry Service'' (''Servicio De Lavanderia'' in Latin America and Spain) was released on November 13, 2001. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart selling over 200,000 records in its first week. ''Laundry Service'' was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA in June 2004 as well.<ref></ref> and thus helped to establish Shakira's musical presence in the mainstream North American market. Seven songs from the album became international singles: \"Whenever, Wherever\" / \"Suerte\", \"Underneath Your Clothes\", \"Objection (Tango)\" / \"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\", \"The One\", \"Te Dejo Madrid\", \"Que Me Quedes Tú\" and \"Poem to a Horse\", with four of the singles becoming largely successful.  Because the album was created for the English language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album gained mild critical success with some critics claimed that her English skills were too weak for her to write songs for it with ''Rolling Stone'' stating \"she sounds downright silly\" or \"Shakira's magic is lost in translation.\" Shakira also was criticized by her Latin fans for seemingly abandoning her folk and rock roots in favor of contemporary American pop music. Despite this fact, the album became the best selling album of 2002, selling more than 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"PRNewswire.com\"/><ref name=\"Shakira biography\"/><ref name=\"shakira.com\" /> and became the most successful album of her career to date. Around this time, Shakira also released four songs for Pepsi for her promotion in the English markets: \"Ask for More\", \"Pide Más\", \"Knock on My Door\" and \"Pídeme el Sol\".  In November 2002, Shakira embarked on the Tour of the Mongoose with 61 shows occurring by May 2003. The tour was also her first worldwide tour, as legs were played in North and South America as well as Europe and Asia. At Aerosmith's MTV Icon in April 2002, Shakira performed \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\". Also in 2002, Shakira joined the likes of Cher, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Mary J. Blige, Anastacia, and the Dixie Chicks for ''VH1 Divas Live Las Vegas''. In September 2002, Shakira won the now-defunct International Viewer's Choice Award at the MTV Video Music Awards with \"Whenever, Wherever\". Shakira also won the Latin Grammy Award for the category of Best Short Form Music Video for the Spanish version of the video. In October of that year, she won five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America for Best Female Artist, Best Pop Artist, Best Artist – North (Region), Video of the Year (for \"Suerte\"), and Artist of the Year. In November 2002, Shakira’s label Sony BMG released her Spanish greatest hits compilation ''Grandes Éxitos''. A DVD and ten-track live album, called ''Live & Off the Record'', was also released in 2004, reaching sales of 3 million worldwide, and commemorating the Tour of the Mongoose.  right|thumb|upright|Shakira at the Rock in Rio festival in 2008   2005–07: ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' and ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2''   After promotion for Shakira's third studio album ended in 2003, Shakira chose to step out of the spotlight to record new music. Many possible release dates for her fourth studio album were announced but later delayed until early 2005 when Shakira announced the title of her fourth record and that Rick Rubin would be the executive producer of the album. It was later announced that the album would instead be two albums. Shakira's fourth studio album, ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'', was released in June 2005. The lead single from the album, \"La Tortura\" reached the top 40 of on the Hot 100 after being released in April 2005 and receiving large scale success on radio. The song also featured the Spanish balladeer Alejandro Sanz. It also spent a record of twenty-five weeks at number one on the U.S. Latin chart. Shakira became the first artist to perform a Spanish language song at the ''MTV Video Music Awards'' in 2005 as well.  Contrary to low expectations, ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' was extremely well received. It debuted at number four on the ''Billboard 200'' chart, selling 157,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold over two million copies in the U.S., earning a 11× Platinum (Latin field) certification from the RIAA. Due to its first week sales, the album became the highest debut ever for a Spanish language album. After only a day of release in Latin America, the album earned certifications. In Venezuela, it earned a Platinum certification, in Colombia, a triple Platinum certification while in Mexico, the album exceeded shipments and was unavailable after only one day of release. The album sold over one million copies in three days worldwide. Four other singles were also released from the album. \"No\", \"Dia De Enero\", \"La Pared\" and \"Las De La Intuición\", with each single reaching number one in countries worldwide.  On February 8, 2006, Shakira won her second Grammy Award with the win of ''Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album'' for ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1''.<ref></ref> Shakira received four Latin Grammy Awards in November 2006, winning the awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year for \"La Tortura\", Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1''.<ref></ref> ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' has since sold over 4 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"ticket4-you1\"/> left|thumb|upright|Shakira at the Rock in Rio festival in 2006 Before the release of ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'', Shakira's second bilingual studio album, Shakira appeared at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2005 in Lisbon, Portugal, where she performed \"Don't Bother\", the lead single from the album, minutes before winning an award in the category of Best Female Artist. \"Don't Bother\", however, failed to achieve chart success in the U.S. by missing the top 40 on the Hot 100. It did, however, reach the top 20 in most countries worldwide. Shakira's second English studio album and fifth studio album, ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'' was released on November 29, 2005. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard 200'', selling 128,000 copies in its first week. The album has gone on to sell 1.8 million records in the U.S., earning a Platinum certification from the RIAA. Oddly enough, the album did not fare as well as its Spanish counterpart in the U.S., selling a few hundred thousand less records overall. ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'' has also gone on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide.<ref></ref> The cover of the album featured Shakira as Eve with forbidden fruit was also considered controversial, and had to be altered in several countries which would not sell the album with that cover.  Despite the commercial failure of the album's lead single in the U.S., it went on to spawn two more singles. \"Hips Don't Lie\", featuring Wyclef Jean, was released as the album's second single in February 2006. The song went on to become the highest selling single of the 21st century and became Shakira's first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching number one in over fifty-five countries. Shakira and Wyclef Jean also recorded a Bamboo version of the song to serve as the official theme of the FIFA World Cup 2006. Shakira, along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, received the most nominations for the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards with \"Hips Don't Lie\", but she won only the award for Best Choreography. Shakira later released the third and final single from the album, \"Illegal\" featuring Carlos Santana, in November 2006. The single reached number one in some European countries and on the U.S. dance chart, though it failed to reach the Hot 100. Shakira embarked on the Oral Fixation Tour, in June 2006. The tour consisted of 125 shows between June 2006 and July 2007. The concert also visited all six continents. One show in Mexico City was performed for free, and earned an audience of over 200,000. This concert sets the record for the highest attendance of any concert in Mexican history. Shakira also performed on July 9, 2006, at the FIFA World Cup final in Germany. In November 2007, the ''Oral Fixation Tour'' DVD was released and is also available in High Definition Blu-ray format.<ref>[http://www.sonybmg.no/nye_utgivelser/kommende_utgivelser/ Sonybmg.no]</ref> The two versions of the DVD have sold over 16 million copies worldwide. In February 2007, Shakira performed for the first time at the 49th Grammy Awards and earned the nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Hips Don’t Lie\" with Wyclef Jean, though she did not win the award.  In late 2006, Shakira and Alejandro Sanz collaborated for the duet ''Te lo Agradezco, Pero No'', which is featured on Sanz' album ''El Tren de los Momentos''. The song was a top ten hit in Latin America, and topped the ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks chart. Shakira also collaborated with Miguel Bosé on the duet \"Si Tú No Vuelves\", which was released in Bosé's album ''Papito'', which celebrates his thirty-year career. In early 2007, Shakira worked with American R&B singer Beyoncé for the track \"Beautiful Liar\", which was released as the second single from the deluxe edition of Knowles' ''B'Day''. In April 2007, the single jumped ninety-one positions, from ninety-four to three, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, setting the record for the largest upward movement in the history of the chart at the time. It was also number one on the official UK Singles Chart. The song earned them a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The song was one of Knowles' and Shakira's most successful worldwide, as it was particularly popular in Spanish-speaking countries such as Argentina and Spain, where it topped charts. According to ''Billboard'', Shakira, along with Lil Wayne would collaborate on a new track for Carlos Santana's greatest hits CD titled ''Ultimate Santana''.<ref></ref> However, this collaboration was cancelled, and Shakira and Lil Wayne were replaced by Jennifer Lopez and Baby Bash. Shakira is featured on Annie Lennox's song \"Sing\", from the album ''Songs of Mass Destruction'', which also features other twenty-three other female singers.<ref name=autogenerated1></ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /> In late 2007, Shakira and Wyclef Jean recorded their second duet \"King and Queen\". The song was featured on Wyclef Jean’s 2007 album ''Carnival Vol. II: Memoirs of an Immigrant''.  Shakira wrote the lyrics and co-wrote the music for two new songs that are featured in the movie ''Love in the Time of Cholera'', based on the acclaimed novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Marquez. García Marquez himself asked Shakira to write the songs.<ref></ref> The songs that Shakira lent to the soundtrack were \"Pienso en ti\", a song from Shakira's breakthrough album ''Pies Descalzos'', \"Hay Amores\" and \"Despedida\". \"Despedida\" was nominated for Best Original Song at the 65th Golden Globe Awards but did not win. It was rumored that the song would also be nominated for an Academy Award, but it was not, with a source calling the fact that it was left off the nominees the Academy's \"worst snub.<ref>[http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2008/01/24/TheScene/A.Second.Opinion-3165739.shtml BCheights.com] ''A Second Opinion''</ref>  2008–11: Live Nation, ''She Wolf'' and ''Sale el Sol''  During an online chat with her fans in ''El Heraldo'' in February 2008,<ref></ref> Shakira revealed that work on her sixth studio album was about to begin. Furthermore, at Shakira's cousin Isa Mebarak's album release party in Colombia, Shakira's father William Mebarak stated that Shakira was currently at work writing and producing new songs for her upcoming album. This was being done in \"her own studio\", which many fans thought to mean the studio at her home in the Bahamas.<ref></ref> Shakira recorded 2005's ''Fijación Oral Vol. 1'' and 2006's ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'' there as well.  After spending two weeks in London, Shakira flew to Colombia for a peace-promoting concert in Leticia (at the three way border of Colombia, Peru and Brazil) with Carlos Vives.
