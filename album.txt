I am fixated on chocolate! I am fixated on the spoken word, the written word, the things I have said and the things I should never have said. This is the reason why I decided on the names for the albums.\" For the album artwork, Shakira called upon Renaissance icons to explain the significance of ''Oral Fixation''. In ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'' the same child from the past album is perched in a tree and reaches for an apple held in Shakira's hand. \"Vol. 2 is more of a Jungian sort of thing, since the reference is to a universal archetype of Eve (Adam and Eve) and the original sin. I think that is something that is really subconsciously in our minds. On the cover of Vol. 2 I wanted to add another reason for Eve to bite the forbidden fruit - that would be her oral fixation.\" The cover was changed in many Middle Eastern regions, mainly in GCC countries, due to the exposure of Shakira's body. It is alternated with one in which the tree leaves extend to cover her belly; it only shows the top of her body and covers the rest.  Reception  The album debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200, selling 128,000 copies in the U.S. in its opening week. It was Shakira's second top five album of the year. When the album was re-released with \"Hips Don't Lie\" and an alternate version of \"La Tortura\", the album shot up 92 spots on the Billboard 200 from #98 to #6. It sold 81,000 copies that week, which was a 643% increase. As of March 8, 2007, the album has sold more than 1,700,000 units in the United States alone.<ref></ref> The album has been certified Platinum by the RIAA in the United States.
